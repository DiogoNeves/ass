*A sophisticated debate system for reaching better answers through AI argumentation*

</div>

## 🎭 What is ASS?

**ASS (Argumentative System Service)** is an advanced debate simulation platform that models how expert-level AI personalities argue, reason, and potentially change their minds when presented with compelling evidence. Using internal belief states and sophisticated reasoning systems, ASS helps explore complex topics from multiple perspectives to arrive at more nuanced, well-considered conclusions.

> **🤖 AI-Generated Project**: This entire project was generated by AI from an original idea by [Diogo](https://github.com/DiogoNeves). The concept, architecture, code, and documentation were all created through an AI-assisted development process, demonstrating the potential of human-AI collaboration in software creation.

**Perfect for:**
- 🧠 **Complex Problem-Solving** - Model expert debates to find optimal solutions
- 🔬 **Research & Analysis** - Explore topics with rigorous, evidence-based reasoning
- 🤔 **Decision Support** - Get high-quality arguments from multiple expert perspectives
- 📚 **Educational Tools** - Demonstrate critical thinking and belief revision
- 🎯 **Truth-Seeking** - Watch AI experts converge on well-reasoned conclusions

## 🎭 Meet the Debaters

| Personality | Provider | Traits | Perspective |
|-------------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **🌟 Claude Optimist** | Claude | Creative, big-picture, opportunity-focused | Sees possibilities everywhere |
| **🔍 Claude Skeptic** | Claude | Analytical, detail-oriented, risk-aware | Points out flaws and limitations |
| **🚀 GPT Visionary** | OpenAI | Forward-thinking, innovative, solution-oriented | Champions breakthrough ideas |
| **⚖️ GPT Critic** | OpenAI | Methodical, cautious, problem-focused | Highlights potential issues |

Each personality maintains internal beliefs about truth while presenting arguments, potentially updating their views when faced with compelling evidence. After reaching consensus through voting, an **impartial Judge** synthesizes all perspectives into a final decision.

## 🧠 Revolutionary Features

### Internal Belief Systems
Each AI personality maintains private beliefs about what's actually true, separate from their public arguments. They can:
- Form expert-level initial assessments based on evidence
- Update beliefs when presented with compelling counter-arguments
- Maintain intellectual honesty while arguing their position

### Dynamic Consensus Building
- Personalities debate until reaching agreement through ranked voting
- Arguments must directly engage with others' points
- Real belief revision when evidence warrants it
- Configurable resistance to changing minds

### Expert-Level Reasoning
- Deep analysis with citations and evidence
- Field-specific expertise applied to questions
- Rigorous logical argumentation
- Truth-seeking balanced with debate dynamics

## 🎬 Example Debates

### 🤖 "Should we develop AGI as fast as possible?"

<details>
<summary>Click to see the debate highlights</summary>

**Claude Optimist:** *"The potential benefits are extraordinary! AGI could solve climate change, cure diseases, and unlock technologies we can't even imagine. The faster we develop it responsibly, the sooner we can address humanity's greatest challenges!"*

**GPT Critic:** *"This rush toward AGI poses existential risks we don't fully understand. Without proper safety frameworks and international oversight, we could create systems that operate beyond human control or comprehension."*

**GPT Visionary:** *"What if we're thinking too small? AGI represents the next evolutionary leap for intelligence itself. With proper safeguards, we could create benevolent systems that enhance human potential rather than replace it."*

**Claude Skeptic:** *"The alignment problem remains unsolved. How can we ensure AGI systems will pursue human values when we haven't even agreed on what those values are? The technical challenges of safe AGI are being dangerously underestimated."*

**Judge's Decision:** *"A measured approach prioritizing safety research alongside capability development, with mandatory international cooperation frameworks..."*

### 🍕 "Is pineapple on pizza acceptable?"

<details>
<summary>Click to see this heated culinary debate</summary>

**Claude Optimist:** *"Pineapple on pizza represents culinary creativity at its finest! The sweet-savory combination creates delightful flavor contrasts, and food should be about joy and experimentation, not rigid rules!"*

**GPT Critic:** *"This combination violates fundamental principles of Italian cuisine. The high water content of pineapple creates soggy crusts, while the sweetness overwhelms the carefully balanced acidity of traditional tomato sauce."*

**GPT Visionary:** *"Hawaiian pizza opened the door to global fusion cuisine! Without this bold experiment, we might never have discovered other amazing combinations like BBQ chicken or breakfast pizzas."*

**Claude Skeptic:** *"Traditional pizza recipes evolved over centuries for good reasons. Adding random fruits doesn't constitute innovation—it's culinary chaos that diminishes the integrity of a perfect food."*

**Judge's Decision:** *"While respecting traditional Italian cuisine, food evolution through cultural fusion has created legitimate new traditions. Pineapple pizza, though controversial, represents valid culinary diversity..."*

## 🎮 How It Works

### 🗳️ Voting Mode (Default)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Your Question] --> B[Iteration 0: Initial Positions]
    B --> C[Iteration 1+: Direct Argumentation]
    C --> D{Voting Phase}
    D -->|No Consensus| C
    D -->|Consensus Reached| E[Judge Reviews Everything]
    E --> F[Final Decision]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style D fill:#fff3cd
    style F fill:#f3e5f5
```

1. **🎯 Question Input** - You provide any question or topic
2. **💭 Initial Positions** - Each personality presents their stance without arguing
3. **🥊 Argumentation** - Personalities directly engage with each other's points
4. **🗳️ Voting** - After each iteration, personalities rank all participants
5. **🔄 Consensus Check** - Continue until voting threshold is reached
6. **⚖️ Judge Review** - Final synthesis with potential override

### 🎭 Classic Mode

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Your Question] --> B[Round 1: Opening Arguments]
    B --> C[Round 2: Rebuttals & Counter-arguments]
    C --> D[Round 3: Final Positions]
    D --> E[Judge's Final Decision]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style E fill:#f3e5f5
```

Use `--classic-mode` to run the original 3-round format.

## 🛠️ Architecture

The application uses a modular architecture with **Pydantic validation** and clear separation of concerns:

```python
# Create a new personality with validated configuration
from models.personality import PersonalityConfig
from personalities import create_personality

new_personality = create_personality(PersonalityConfig(
    name="My Custom Debater",
    model_provider="claude",  # or "openai" or "local"
    model_name="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241112",
    system_prompt="Your personality description...",
    reasoning_depth=8,
