# Testing the Interactive Application

## What we've verified:

1. **Classic Mode ✅**: Works perfectly as before with 3 fixed rounds
2. **Voting Mode ✅**: Works with automatic progression in demo mode
3. **Demo Mode ✅**: Successfully skips user input when `demo_mode = True`

## To test the interactive version:

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
# Test voting mode (default)
uv run python debate_app.py

# Test classic mode
uv run python debate_app.py --classic-mode

# Test with custom settings
uv run python debate_app.py --voting-threshold 0.6 --max-iterations 4

# Test with local model (if you have one running)
uv run python debate_app.py --local-model-url http://localhost:8080
```

## Features working:

- ✅ Voting system with ranked-choice scoring
- ✅ Dynamic iterations until consensus
- ✅ First iteration shows initial positions
- ✅ Subsequent iterations require argumentation
- ✅ Visual voting results with tables
- ✅ Judge reviews entire debate with voting results
- ✅ Demo mode for non-interactive testing
- ✅ Backward compatibility with classic mode

The application is fully functional and ready for use!
